Welcome to my portfolio for CS-305 at SNHU. This repository contains selected projects showcasing my skills in software security and vulnerability assessment. Below, you will find reflections on my work, including the Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report.

## Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report

### Client Summary
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that handles sensitive financial data. They required a comprehensive vulnerability assessment of their software to ensure data security and compliance with legal standards. The company wanted to address potential security vulnerabilities that could compromise their system.

### What I Did Well
I was particularly thorough in identifying and documenting software security vulnerabilities. This included conducting both manual and automated reviews to uncover weaknesses in the codebase. Ensuring secure coding practices is essential to protect sensitive data and maintain client trust, adding significant value to the companyâ€™s overall well-being.

### Challenges and Learning
One challenging aspect was managing the large number of dependencies and their associated vulnerabilities. Using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check helped streamline this process. This experience highlighted the importance of regular dependency management and staying updated with security patches.

### Increasing Layers of Security
To increase security, I implemented input validation, authentication, and authorization mechanisms using Spring Security. In the future, I would use comprehensive static and dynamic analysis tools to assess vulnerabilities and choose appropriate mitigation techniques.

### Ensuring Functionality and Security
After refactoring the code, I conducted extensive testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests, to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. Using secure coding practices and regular code reviews ensured the application remained both functional and secure.

### Resources and Tools
Key resources and tools used included:
- **OWASP Dependency-Check**: For identifying vulnerable dependencies.
- **Spring Security**: For implementing robust authentication and authorization.
- **JUnit**: For unit testing to ensure code functionality.
- **SonarQube**: For static code analysis and maintaining code quality.

### Demonstrating Skills to Employers
From this assignment, I can showcase my ability to conduct thorough vulnerability assessments, implement secure coding practices, and manage dependencies effectively. These skills are crucial for ensuring software security and compliance in a professional environment.
