Why would you want to use a CA for security?

 A certificate authority (CA) issues digital certificates, which enable the recipients of secure connections to be confident that the identity of the entity that they are interacting with (typically a website or an email server) has been verified. Specifically, users of a CA for security can trust websites and services (the certificantees) issuing CAs because the CA is the trusted third party providing this authentication of identity.

What are the advantages of using a CA?

 Third party recognition: There are only so many organisations in the world that are generally recognised and trusted enough to be able to vouch for somebody’s identity and issue a certificate of authentication. We all know the CA.

 Authentication: CAs can verify the holder of a certificate to provide that the users are going to a known website or service.

 Encryption: CAs issue and validate certificates for secure, encrypted communications over networks, allowing for confidential information to remain protected against prying eyes and against intrusions.

 CA-issued certificates: Digital certificate credits are necessary or helpful for many industries and regulatory agencies wanting to facilitate secure and trusted web communications or facilitation of online transactions and business. 

 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): They serve a crucial role in many security protocols, including SSL/TLS, electronic mail encryption, and code signing based on the use of people’s so-called public keys (as opposed to their private keys, which they do not reveal).
